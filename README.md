## SLAM & Navigation

I used the [cartographer](https://github.com/cartographer-project/cartographer_ros) and [gmapping](https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping) to perform SLAM. The mobile robot is [Robotnik's](https://robotnik.eu/) Summit, and the manipulator robot is [Franka's](https://franka.de/) PANDA. 

This repository is for **simulation** purposes.
