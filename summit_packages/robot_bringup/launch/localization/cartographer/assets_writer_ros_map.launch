<!--
  Using this will generate one .pgm and one .yaml file that together
  form the typical occupancy grid ROS map. It performs optimizations
  to give a much more precise result than directly using the map_saver
  to record the occupancy_grid data.
  The files will be placed in the same directory of the bag file.
  Remember to change configuration in the lua config_file.
